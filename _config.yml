          An app to save favourite or secret spots that may be “off the beaten path”.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Encouraging exploration of nature, the main feature of this app is saving beautiful locations you may 
          have stumbled upon or would like to visit again. Perhaps a specific spot deep in a forest, a small unnamed creek,
          or an unusual bank that's perfect for sunset picnics. 
          
          Storing data is achieved via Room Library and associated components, while displaying data is achieved using Recycler View,
          custom views, Maps and interchangeable fragments. Search, edit and delete functionality are also implemented.
