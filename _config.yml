          The goal of the tool was to evaluate the possibility of transforming hand-sketched
          UML Class Diagrams into formal PlantUML models, using image processing and computer vision algorithms
          in the OpenCV library. Without machine learning, the tool achieved overall Precision and Recall metrics
          of 0.86 and 0.88 respectively.

          Written with C# and .NET to learn the language, learn turn-based game logic and work with a database.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          The WPF application is designed with separation of logic and presentation in mind, via implementation of a three-layer architecture:
          presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer. Delegates are used together with events to create an event-driven application.
          Inspiration for handling the running of the game was taken from roguelike games, using a game loop and classes for handling game events.

          An Android mobile app to save favourite or secret spots that may be “off the beaten path”.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Encouraging exploration of nature, the main feature of this app is saving beautiful locations you may 
          have stumbled upon or would like to visit again. Perhaps a specific spot deep in a forest, a small unnamed creek,
          or an unusual bank that's perfect for sunset picnics. 
          
          Storing data is achieved via Room Library and associated components, while displaying data is achieved using Recycler View,
          custom views, Maps and interchangeable fragments. Search, edit and delete functionality are also implemented.
