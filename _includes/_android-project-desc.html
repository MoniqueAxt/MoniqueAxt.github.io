        <div><b>Display saved locations</b>
            <p> The main function of the app is to store and display user-saved data. Custom views, Room Library,
                RecyclerViews, (Android) View Model and Adapter classes were used to achieve this.

                This fragment is reached via the user selecting 'view' on the <i>Locations</i> (home) screen, or it is
                automatically navigated to from the <i>Add New</i> screen after a location is saved, using the
                Navigation component. A (custom class) <i>location object</i> is sent via a Bundle and the fields are
                filled with
                this information. If possible, locations are saved in the database with a Places API code which is then
                used
                here to call a FetchPhotoRequest.
            </p>
            <p>
                This screen also features a FAB-menu (<i>see FAB menu</i>) containing options to edit, delete or view
                the location on the map. The latter option navigates with a Bundle to the Map fragment.

                The Map screen displays custom map markers representing saved locations within a specified radius (set
                in the settings). Tapping on a map marker's info-window results in navigation to the display fragment

                A user can also reach this screen by using the <i>Card swipe</i> feature on the home <i>Locations</i>
                screen (<i>see Locations List</i>). When this happens, the map will move the camera to the swiped

                This displays the list of locations saved in the database. A Recycler View container is included in the
                layout of fragment and CardViews are used to display each item in the database.
            </p>
            <p>
                The RecyclerViewAdapter is used for the search and swipe functionality to get an individual location
                (database row), and when observing with the associated ViewModel to fetch all database rows.
            </p>
            <p>
                A user can also tap the image at the top of the screen (a custom view) which displays a location chosen
                randomly from the database. This is done via the associated ViewModel and using a query that requests a
                location ordered by random with a limit of 1.

            <p>
                When the application is first installed (determined by checking SharedPreferences), three example
                locations are created and saved. These quickly and effectively explain the functionality of this screen.
                That is,
                illustrating how a location will be displayed and indicating that each item can be clicked/tapped or
                swiped (<i>see Search</i>, <i>see Swipe</i>).

                The swipe functionality is achieved within an extended ItemTouchHelper class that uses GestureDetector,

                The Add New screen provides the ability to create or edit a location. Which mode to load is determined
                simply by checking getArguments() and setting a boolean variable depending on whether the former has

                Navigation to this screen occurs either by manually selecting the option in the bottom-navigation panel,
                or automatically when a user chooses to edit a location (either via swiping on the home screen, or via
                the
                FAB-menu when viewing the location (<i>See Locations List, see Saved Locations</i>). Like the other
                fragment
                classes, an associated AndroidViewModel is used to observe data changes in the database, and navigation
                is done
                using NavHostFragment with a Bundle.
            </p>
            <p>
                In adding-new mode, the user is navigated to the display fragment (<i>see Saved Location</i>) with a
                Bundle containing the newly saved location, which is used to fill the fields. Each location is marked as
                unique
                by its coordinates and duplicates are not allowed. Before a location is saved, the database is queried
                against
                the provided coordinates. If the location already exists, the user is informed and offered the option of
                editing the already-saved location.
            </p>
                In editing mode, a Bundle containing the (location) object to edit is used to fill the form fields and
                an "Update" button is displayed instead of a "Save" button.
