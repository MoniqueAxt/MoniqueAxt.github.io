### Hello

I am a Software Engineering student (graduating 2023) who is excited about working with anything related
to technology and electronics. Originally from South Africa, I moved to Sweden to pursue a degree in software.

This goal of this website is to be the starting point of building a fantastic portfolio.
It's a continuous work-in-progress that I'm enjoying improving.
(<em>From the fantastic theme by [Phlow](https://github.com/Phlow/feeling-responsive)</em>).

Main skills: <mark>Java</mark> <mark>C++</mark> <mark>PHP</mark> <mark>Android</mark><br>
Dabbled in : Python, C, RxJava, JavaScript, Linux, PostgreSQL.

My interests include <mark>embedded systems</mark>, <mark>mobile app development</mark>, <mark>database management</mark> and all things <mark>backend</mark>.

### Soft skills

- Having worked in social roles in retail, as a Fitness Coach and a Teaching Assistant, I have learned the importance of being able
to successfully work with others in a team, how to resolve conflicts, and the value of compromise, effective communication and patience.
- As a manager in two different roles I had to be responsible, organised, and able to take initiative.
- Moving abroad and studying in a second-language required perseverance, hard work and an ability to self-motivate.  

### My story

##### South Africa

While studying and working full-time in a retail management position, I started paying more 
attention to my exercise and nutrition in my free time. I discovered a love for fitness and enrolled in a 
night-program to learn more about the field. Eventually I graduated as a Personal Trainer and was able to quit my retail job to pursue fitness as a career.
Working in a private studio, I re-discovered my love of learning and specialised in pre- and post-natal training.

While I enjoyed this role immensely, the unusual working hours were not sustainable long-term and I
began considering alternative career options in Europe.

##### Sweden

Computers have always been an interest of mine; I was surrounded by relatives in the field throughout my childhood.
After finding several fantastic Software Engineering programs, Sweden was my chosen destination.
I saved enough money, sold all my possessions, and moved abroad.

Once I selected my preferred program, I began the journey of meeting the requirements: 
- *Swedish at a university level*. This is the language of instruction in my program and in 
order to qualify I completed SFI and three levels of Svenska som Andrasp√•k.
- *Mathematik C/3*. My grades from South Africa were not recognised, so I enrolled in Komvux
and re-did all math courses.

After completing these, I was excited to be accepted into my preferred program: [Programvaruteknik](https://www.miun.se/programvaruteknik).
This degree program is done via distance, which has given me fantastic skills in being self-motivated, disciplined and responsible.

#### Future
I'm looking forward to contributing to the field of software and eager to complete my degree. Currently, my interests include
<mark>embedded systems</mark>, <mark>mobile app development</mark>, <mark>database management</mark> and all things <mark>backend</mark>.
