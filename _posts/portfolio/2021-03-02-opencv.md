### Source code and Description

Created as part of a thesis, this application was written in C++ with the <a href="https://opencv.org/" target="_blank">OpenCV</a> library.
The goal of the tool was to evaluate the possibility of transforming hand-sketched UML Class Diagrams into formal PlantUML models, using image processing techniques
in the OpenCV library.

The README <a href="https://github.com/MoniqueAxt/SketchToPlantUML#readme" target="_blank">here</a> contains instructions on
how to build the project using CMake and OpenCV as well as an overview on the various computer vision algorithms
used to test the above idea.

### Results

Precision and Recall evaluation metrics and Classification results 

| UML element | Precision | Recall   | | |  Qty  |  TP  |  FP  |  FN  |
|-------------|-----------|----------| | |-------|------|------|----- |
| Classes     | 0.92      | 0.96     | | |  232  |  196 |  8   |  16  |
| Inheritance | 0.92      | 0.92     | | |  37   |  34  |  3   |  3   |
| Association | 0.76      | 0.76     | | |  139  |  105 |  34  |  34  |
| **Total**   | **0.86**  | **0.88** | | |  **388**  |  **335** |  **45**  |  **53**  |

*TP = true positives, FP = false positives, FN = false negatives.*
